# Memories

Use **Memories** in [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai) to inspect all memories created by your configured applications and agents.

The page supports two ways to explore data:

- **Table** view for row-based inspection
- **Knowledge graph** view for relationship-first exploration

## Start in Table View

The default table flow uses two tabs:

- **Memories** for individual memory rows
- **Subjects** for extracted entities/subjects and their counts

Use **Semantic search** to find relevant rows quickly, then open the view menu to switch between **Table** and **Knowledge graph**.

### Memories tab

- **Summary**: The memory text captured from conversations
- **Entity ID**: The associated entity for that memory
- **Recalls**: Number of times this memory was retrieved
- **# of mentions**: How often this memory was mentioned in context
- **Last retrieved**: Most recent retrieval time
- **Created at**: When the memory was first created

### Subjects tab

- **Subject**: Extracted subject/entity value
- **Type**: Entity class (for example `GPE`, `PRODUCT`, `ORGANIZATION`, `MONEY`)
- **Memory count**: Number of memories linked to that subject
- **Created at**: Subject creation date

The **All types** filter helps narrow the table by subject type.

## Open Memory Details

1. In **Memories**, click any row.
2. Review the **Memory details** panel.
3. Use the embedded **Subjects** graph and list to inspect associations.

The **Details** section includes:

- **Memory ID**
- **Entity ID**
- **Importance score**
- **Created at**
- **Last retrieved**
- **Recalls**
- **# of mentions**

## Switch to Knowledge Graph

1. Open the view switcher and select **Knowledge graph**.
2. Use the **Entities** tab to explore nodes and relationships.
3. Filter with **Search memories** and time range (for example **All time**).

## Recommended Exploration Workflow

1. Start in **Memories** table to validate recency and retrieval metrics.
2. Open **Memory details** to verify entity associations and subject links.
3. Switch to **Knowledge graph** to follow cross-entity relationships.
4. Open an entity and trace back through **Associated memories**.
