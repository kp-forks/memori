# Analytics

Use **Analytics** in [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai) to monitor memory creation, recall activity, traffic trends, and quota usage.

Use the date selector (for example **Last 7 days**) to scope metrics, and check **Last refreshed** for data freshness.

**What Each Data Point Means:**

| Data point                        | Meaning                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Total memories created**        | Total number of memory records created in the selected time range.                         |
| **Total entities**                | Number of unique extracted entities attached to memories in the selected range.            |
| **Total memories recalled**       | Number of memory retrieval events served in the selected range.                            |
| **Cache hit rate**                | Percentage of recall requests served from cache instead of a full retrieval path.          |
| **Total conversations**           | Number of conversation threads processed by Memori.                                        |
| **Total sessions**                | Number of distinct sessions in the selected range.                                         |
| **Total users**                   | Number of distinct end users represented by tracked entities/sessions.                     |
| **Trend chart**                   | Time-series trend for the active activity metric across the selected period.               |
| **Monthly quota resets on ...**   | Date when monthly limits reset for your organization.                                      |
| **Memories created** (usage bar)  | Current month created-memory usage vs monthly plan limit.                                  |
| **Memories recalled** (usage bar) | Current month recall usage vs monthly plan limit.                                          |
| **Top subjects**                  | Ranked subjects/entities by memory volume, with entity type tags and relative volume bars. |

## Read the Page in Order

1. Start with the top KPI cards to understand overall volume and retrieval load.
2. Check **Activity and performance** for traffic trends and directional changes (up/down percentages).
3. Review **Monthly usage** to confirm distance from quota limits.
4. Use **Top subjects** to see which entities dominate memory creation.

## Interpreting Directional Changes

- Green upward changes indicate growth versus the comparison period.
- Red downward changes indicate decreases versus the comparison period.
- Combine change percentages with absolute counts to avoid overreacting to small-volume shifts.
