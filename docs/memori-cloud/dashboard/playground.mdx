# Playground

Use **Playground** in [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai) to test how conversation turns become extracted memories and relationship graphs.

## Playground Layout

The screen is split into three working areas:

- Left navigation: **Memories**, **API keys**, **Playground**, **Documentation**, **Settings**
- Center panel: **Playground** conversation and composer
- Right column: **Memory usage**, **Extracted memories** with **Clean**, and **Memory graph** with expand

This layout keeps input, extracted output, and relationship visualization on one page so you can validate memory behavior quickly.

## Core Workflow

1. Chat in **Playground** with user details or preferences.
2. Watch new records appear in **Extracted memories**.
3. Verify those same facts and links in **Memory graph**.
4. Use the graph expand control for deeper inspection when needed.

## Memory Graph

**Memory graph** is a relationship view over the same memory set shown in **Extracted memories**.

- Nodes represent subjects and entities (for example: `User`, `Emma`, `Queens`, `NYC Juniors`).
- Edges show relation text (for example: `has name`, `lives in`, `plays as`).
- Use the expand icon to open a larger graph canvas for graph-first review.

## Extracted Memories and Persistence

The **Extracted memories** list shows normalized memory statements such as:

- `Northeastern University located in Boston, Massachusetts`
- `User plays as libero`
- `User played club volleyball growing up for NYC Juniors`

These memories are persisted as records in the database and are generated asynchronously through advanced augmentation after conversation turns are processed.
