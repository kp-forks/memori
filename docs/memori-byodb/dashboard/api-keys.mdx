# API Keys

Use the **API keys** page in [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai)
to create and manage keys for your organization.

## Overview

The table includes:

- **Name**
- **Key** (masked)

- **Last used**

If no keys are connected yet, the table shows **No connected APIs.**

## Create a New API Key

1. Open **API keys** in the dashboard sidebar.
2. Click **Create API key**.
3. In **New API key**, enter a value in **Name**.
4. Click **Create key**.

## Security Best Practices

<Admonition type="danger" title="Never Commit API Keys">
  Never commit API keys to version control. Treat API keys like passwords.
</Admonition>

- Store keys in environment variables or a secure secrets manager
- Rotate keys immediately if you suspect exposure
- Use separate keys for development, staging, and production
