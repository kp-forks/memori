# Development Setup

This guide walks you through setting up a local development environment for working on the Memori codebase. Follow these steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the test suite.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10 or higher** — Memori requires Python 3.10+. Check your version with `python --version`.
- **git** — For cloning the repository and managing branches.
- **pip** — Python's package manager (usually included with Python).

## Clone the Repository

Start by forking the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Memori.git
cd Memori
```

If you plan to submit a pull request, make sure to keep your fork synced with the upstream repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori.git
git fetch upstream
```

## Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

<CodeGroup title="Virtual Environment Setup">

```bash {{ title: 'venv (Built-in)' }}
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

```bash {{ title: 'conda' }}
conda create -n memori python=3.12
conda activate memori
```

</CodeGroup>

Once your virtual environment is active, install Memori with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs Memori in editable mode (`-e`) so that changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected without reinstalling. The `[dev]` extra includes testing and linting tools.

If the project uses a `requirements-dev.txt` file instead, install with:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Running Tests

Memori uses pytest for its test suite. Run all tests from the project root:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
pytest -v
```

To run a specific test file or test function:

```bash
# Run all tests in a specific file
pytest tests/test_openai.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/test_openai.py::test_sync_completion
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest --cov=memori --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Local Development Workflow

Here is a typical workflow for making changes to Memori:

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** — Edit the source code in the `memori/` directory.

3. **Write tests** — Add or update tests in the `tests/` directory to cover your changes.

4. **Run the tests** to make sure nothing is broken:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Check code style** — The project uses Ruff for linting and formatting:

   ```bash
   # Lint
   ruff check .

   # Format
   ruff format --check .
   ```

6. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add support for Redis storage backend"
   ```

7. **Push to your fork** and open a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-new-feature
   ```

## Project Structure

Here is a high-level overview of the Memori repository structure:

| Directory   | Purpose                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `memori/`   | Core library source code        |
| `tests/`    | Test suite (pytest)             |
| `docs/`     | Documentation source files      |
| `examples/` | Example scripts and usage demos |

The core integration logic for each LLM provider typically lives in separate modules within the `memori/` directory. When adding support for a new provider, look at existing integrations (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) as templates.
