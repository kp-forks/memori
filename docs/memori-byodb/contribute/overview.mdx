## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Memori, and not all of them involve writing code:

### Report Bugs

Found a bug? Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori/issues) with:

- A clear title describing the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- What you expected to happen versus what actually happened
- Your Python version, OS, and Memori version (`pip show memori`)

### Suggest Features

Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori/discussions) or an issue tagged with `enhancement`. Describe the use case and why it would be valuable.

### Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome. This includes:

- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding new examples or use cases
- Improving the guides for specific LLM providers or databases
- Translating documentation

### Contribute Code

Ready to write some code? Here is the process:

1. **Fork the repository** — Create your own fork of [MemoriLabs/Memori](https://github.com/MemoriLabs/Memori) on GitHub
2. **Create a branch** — Branch off `main` with a descriptive name (for example, `fix/streaming-bug` or `feat/redis-support`)
3. **Make your changes** — Write your code, add tests, and update documentation if needed
4. **Run the tests** — Make sure all existing tests pass and your new tests cover the changes
5. **Submit a pull request** — Open a PR back to the `main` branch with a clear description of what you changed and why

See the [Development Setup](/docs/memori-byodb/contribute/development-setup) guide for instructions on setting up your local environment.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request:

- **Keep PRs focused** — One feature or fix per PR. This makes review faster and easier.
- **Write descriptive commit messages** — Explain what changed and why, not just what files were modified.
- **Include tests** — New features should include tests. Bug fixes should include a test that reproduces the bug.
- **Update documentation** — If your change affects the public API or user-facing behavior, update the relevant docs.
- **Follow existing patterns** — Look at how existing code is structured and follow the same conventions.
