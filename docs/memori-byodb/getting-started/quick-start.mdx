# Quick Start

Get started with Memori in under 3 minutes. Since Memori BYODB is open source, you bring your own database — and for this quick start, we will use SQLite so there is nothing extra to install.

<Note>
  Want a zero-setup option? Try Memori Cloud at
  [app.memorilabs.ai](https://app.memorilabs.ai).
</Note>

In this example, we will use Memori with OpenAI and SQLite. Check out the [LLM providers](/docs/memori-byodb/llm/overview) and [database](/docs/memori-byodb/databases/overview) guides for other integrations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

## Step 1: Install Libraries

Install Memori and the OpenAI SDK:

<CodeGroup title="Install Memori">

```bash {{ title: 'pip' }}
pip install memori openai
```

```bash {{ title: 'poetry' }}
poetry add memori openai
```

```bash {{ title: 'uv' }}
uv add memori openai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Memori Application

Create a new Python file `quickstart.py` and add the following code:

### Setup & Configuration

Import libraries, set up a SQLite database with Python's built-in `sqlite3`, and initialize Memori with your OpenAI client.

- `conn` accepts a connection factory (SQLAlchemy, DB-API 2.0, Django ORM, or MongoDB callable)
- `llm.register()` wraps your LLM client for automatic memory capture
- `attribution()` links memories to a specific user and process
- `build()` creates the Memori schema tables in your database

```python
import os
import sqlite3
from memori import Memori
from openai import OpenAI

def get_sqlite_connection():
    return sqlite3.connect("memori.db")

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
mem = Memori(conn=get_sqlite_connection).llm.register(client)
mem.attribution(entity_id="user_123", process_id="test-ai-agent")
mem.config.storage.build()
```

If your app already uses SQLAlchemy, you can pass a `sessionmaker` instead:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from memori import Memori

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///memori.db")
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

mem = Memori(conn=SessionLocal)
```

### First Conversation

Tell the LLM a fact about yourself. Memori automatically captures the
conversation and processes it through Advanced Augmentation.

Since augmentation runs asynchronously, call `augmentation.wait()` in
short-lived scripts to ensure memories are fully processed before continuing.

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "My favorite color is blue."}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content + "\n")

# Wait for background augmentation to finish
mem.augmentation.wait()
```

### Memory Recall

Create a completely new client and Memori instance — no prior context
carried over. When you ask the LLM what it remembers, Memori
automatically injects the relevant facts via semantic search.

The second response should correctly recall your favorite color, proving
memory persistence works across sessions.

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

mem = Memori(conn=get_sqlite_connection).llm.register(client)
mem.attribution(entity_id="user_123", process_id="test-ai-agent")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's my favorite color?"}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content + "\n")
```

## Step 4: Run the Application

Execute your Python file:

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

You should see the AI respond to both questions, with the second response correctly recalling that your favorite color is blue!

## Step 5: Inspect Your Memories

Since you own the database, you can inspect what Memori stored directly:

<CodeGroup title="Inspect Memories">

```bash {{ title: 'Messages' }}
sqlite3 memori.db "SELECT * FROM memori_conversation_message;"
```

```bash {{ title: 'Facts' }}
sqlite3 memori.db "SELECT * FROM memori_entity_fact;"
```

```bash {{ title: 'Knowledge Graph' }}
sqlite3 memori.db "SELECT * FROM memori_knowledge_graph;"
```

```bash {{ title: 'Sessions' }}
sqlite3 memori.db "SELECT * FROM memori_session;"
```

</CodeGroup>
